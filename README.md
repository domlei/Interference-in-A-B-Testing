# Project Abstract
A/B testing and experimentation is currently common among companies offering services online, particularly 
social media. Ability to collect various data and related usage metrics from customers makes this 
experimentation design useful in solving if new implementations or already existing factors are causing the 
outcome. A possible and disrupting occurrence in this scenario is interference. Han et al. (2022) give a 
motivating example of an A/B test implemented by LinkedIn in which interference is a likely cause. To solve 
this issue, they propose a set of algorithms to test for interference in various cases. In this paper algorithms 1-3 
from the study are replicated and compared to the original paper. Lastly, some considerations for implementing 
the algorithms are given.
